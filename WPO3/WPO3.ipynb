    "### Goal\n",
    "The goal of this practical session is to get an insight into architecture and basic functionalities of an automatic bone cancer detection system using real life medical image dataset of metastatic bone disease patients. Your tasks will involve examining and preprocessing the data, training various classifiers and validating the performance of your system against the ground-truth predictions done manually by an experienced radiologist. Students must send their notebook using the Dropbox functionality of Ufora or Assignment functionality of Canvas before the __19th of March, 2020, midnight. Remember to include the HTML format!.__ The grade from this practical session will contribute to your final grade.\n",

    "### Metastatic bone disease MRI dataset\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Bone metastases\n",
    "Cancer that begins in an organ, such as lungs, breast or prostate, and then spreads via blood stream or lymph vessels to the bone is called a __metastatic bone disease__ (MBD). Bone metastases mostly affect axial skeleton, pelvis and upper parts of the femur bones. Patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer have more than 50% chance to develop bone metastases. MBD results in severe bone pain, fractures, spinal cord compression and eventually death.\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Assessment of treatment response\n",
    "In order to assess the treatment response of a MBD patient over time, the volume and several functional properties of all present bone metastases have to be compared before and after the treatment. This is done using various whole-body medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography, bone scintigraphy or magnetic resonance imaging. A decrease in tumour volume over time usually indicates good response to the treatment. However, the assessment of the response to treatment of bone lesions has been considered difficult and time consuming, compared to lesions involving soft tissues or other organs. Commercial software that enable radiologists to interactively or semi-automatically define individual volumes of interest (VOIs) is beginning to emerge. However, in patients with metastatic bone disease, the number of metastases can be large, making it impractical and extremely time consuming to use such software to evaluate all lesions. This motivates us to work on fully automated segmentation algorithms for the extraction of bone metastases, which could greatly facilitate the disease management for such patients. Additionally, it could also provide valuable tools for studies on large patient populations.\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Whole-body MRI\n",
    "Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers excellent sensitivity for the detection of neoplastic cells within the bone marrow using so-called anatomic sequences. Basic sequences, i.e. T1-weighted sequences, provide a high contrast between the low signal intensity of the lesions and the high signal intensity of the surrounding marrow. This contrast enables lesion measurement and has been shown feasible in prostate and breast cancer metastases.\n",
    "Additionally, due to the development of parallel imaging and ultra-fast MRI sequences (i.e. echo-planar imaging), functional sequences can be additionally acquired. The whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (WB-DWI) showed a great potential in tumour detection [<cite>[1]</cite>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510426)[<cite>[2]</cite>](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091779).  Moreover, the technique provides quantitative functional parameters showing early changes after therapy: apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)[<cite>[3]</cite>](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/apparent-diffusion-coefficient-1) and allows for computations of artificial images: high b-value computed DWI [<cite>[4]</cite>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21852566)\n",

    "#### Anatomical and functional images\n",
    "![modalities](modalities.png)\n",
    "The above image represents all whole-body MRI image modalities used to characterize bone metastases (marked with red arrows). From the left:\n",
    "- T1 anatomical image (bone metastases are darker than the healthy bone)\n",
    "- B-0 diffusion weighted image (lesions are usually brighter than normal bone)\n",
    "- B-1000 diffusion weighted image (lesions are usually much brighter than normal bone)\n",
    "- ADC map (lesions usually lie within a range of 600 to 1200 voxel intensity value)\n",
    "- B-1500 and B-2000 computed diffusion weighted image (lesions are usually much brighter than normal bone, less false positive high intensity signal (e.g. kidneys, bladder)\n",

    "The following image shows a manual delineation of lesions done by radiologist using T1 anatomy image (superior resolution). Segmentation was mapped on complementary image modalities (B-0, B-1000 and ADC respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "![lesions_zoom](lesions_zoom.png)\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Features:\n",
    "The goal of the classification task (binary classification) is to determine if a certain voxel of patient's skeleton corresponds to bone lesion or healthy bone tissue, which will allow to automatically construct a segmentation image highlighting bone metastases. In order to do so, you are provided with a dataset consisting of a list of all voxels of the skeleton tissue from 9 metastatic bone disease patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each skeleton voxel has an independent set of features describing its individual properties:\n",
    "- The medical diagnosis label assessed by a radiologist via manual segmentation: *healthy* or *lesion*.\n",
    "- The (x, y ,z) 3D position coordinates. \n",
    "- A set of 5 unique features representing its intensity values across each of 6 different modalities used (T1, B-0, B-1000, ADC, B-1500, B-2000):\n",
    "        a) Intensity of a voxel \n",
    "        b) Mean intensity of a kernel of size 5 around the voxel of interest\n",
    "        c) Median intensity of a kernel of size 5 around the voxel of interest\n",
    "        d) Maximum intensity of a kernel of size 5 around the voxel of interest\n",
    "        e) Minimum  intensity of a kernel of size 5 around the voxel of interest\n",
    "        \n",
    "All features were computed automatically, using automatic image processing algorithms. In total the dataset consists of 291776 voxels labeled *healthy* or *lesion*. The dataset is balanced and has a 50-50 distribution: 145888 *healthy* voxels, 145888 *lesion* voxels.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the way the features were extracted in [<cite>[5]</cite>](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/9414/1/Spinal-focal-lesion-detection-in-multiple-myeloma-using-multimodal-image/10.1117/12.2081990.short?SSO=1), where authors have used a similar feature extraction method. \n"

    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. __Handling missing data.__ Most machine learning algorithms cannot work with missing features, so let's take care of that. Use panda's function *info()* to check if any feature has missing 'not-a-number' values. You can solve that problem easily by either dropping those lines with a *dropna()* function or setting them to zero, mean or median of the feature column (function *fillna()*). Because the more the data, usually, the better the performance of the classifier, lets substitute the missing values with the median of the column in which the values are missing.\n",

Append empty dataframes with new data with every iteration of the loop. The function should return a formated intensity dataframe and Y dataframe containing the label column. \n",
